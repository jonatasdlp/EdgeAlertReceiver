# Workflow Skill

## Development Flow
1. Reproduce and log baseline behavior.
2. Apply smallest safe change.
3. Validate with runtime logs and expected callbacks.
4. Summarize changed files and verification results.

## Git/PR Expectations
- Keep commits scoped and readable.
- Include why + what changed + validation evidence.
- Avoid unrelated refactors in bug-fix PRs.
