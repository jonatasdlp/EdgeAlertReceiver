# AI Workspace

This folder organizes stable guidance and live project context so LLM agents can work with high accuracy.

## Structure
- `skills/`: Stable rules and conventions.
- `contexts/`: Current state, known issues, and decisions.
- `tasks/`: Task-by-task execution records/templates.

## Usage
1. Keep `skills/` short and stable.
2. Update `contexts/current-state.md` after meaningful changes.
3. Add/close task docs in `tasks/` for each work item.
